You should be able to say javac *.java to compile the package.

The Makefile in this directory is a GNU makefile.  If you have gnu make, you
will be able to compile the system by typing make.  If you don't have
it, you can get it at prep.ai.mit.edu or ftp.cdrom.com.

To run the system, you start with the platform specific main class.  Currently
there is only 1, ntnfs.  So to run the server type:

	java ntnfs

There is an access control mechanism based on IP addresses numbers in this
NFS server.  At startup time it reads in the file exports, which is a list
of file systems and addresses.  Any mount request is compared to this list.
This is pretty much the same as on UNIX systems without any flags - all mounts
are read write, etc.  Following is an example exports line to allow anyone
in the class C network 10.1.2.0 to mount c:\shared.  The /24 at the end is
the number of significant bits in the address - more bits means more 
restrictive.

	c:\shared	10.1.2.0/24

It helps if you give the java runtime more memory.  Otherwise it may run out
during periods of high activity.  This can be done with the -mx flag.
