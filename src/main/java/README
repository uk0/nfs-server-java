This package contains a pure java implementation of the NFS server protocol.
It includes the NFS service, the Mountd service and the Portmapper.  
Everything needed to export file systems is provided.

NFS identifies files by numbers (called file handles or fhandles).  This is
the inode plus the file system id on a UNIX system.  Since Java doesn't provide
this kind of information, I generate a serial number for each file when it is
first accessed and store this number in a file called cache.  If the server
sees this file it will load the contents into memory before running.  This
allows you to stop and restart the NFS server without having to unmount and
remount the file systems remotely.

Java isn't quite as advertized, platform independent.  There are a couple of
things which have to be handled on a per platform basis.  These services are
encapsulated in classes and implementations are provided for some platforms.

The things which are platform specific are:

	1: File names - java provides classes to access files, but they all
	   take Strings for the file name.  These strings are platform 
	   specific, for example on Windows NT you can open the file
	   c:\hithere.txt, on UNIX you might pass in /home/hithere.txt.

	2: Time stamps - there is a way to get modify times on files in java
	   but it returns a platform specific value.  On windows NT it returns
	   the DOS modify time (100 ns intervals since 1600).  There is a
	   class called the TimeMapper which handles converting this into
	   UNIX/NFS time (seconds since 1970).

Currently there is a complete implementation for WinNT/Win95 (they are the
same in this package).  At one point there was a UNIX implementation but
since all UNIXs seem to have NFS servers already, and the Java implementations
on UNIX tend to be slow, I have stopped working on that code.
