//   the handle of the file, and a flag indicating whether this handle
//   is read only.  The rest of the 32 bytes are not used, but since
//   NFS clients think two files are the same iff the fhandles are the
//   same, make sure this always gives out the same fhandle by
//   setting the rest of the data to 0.
