Version 1.2 of jnfs has some changes that affect the performance.
Also, I've put the code into a different directory from the classes
files and the config files in the top level directory.  

To run from the jnfs directory, type:

	java -classpath Classes ntnfs

The file exports must be in the directory that the server is being
run from.

Please send me email if you find any bugs.
